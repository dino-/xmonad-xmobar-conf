The widget icons were made by "sm4tik" for purposes of "dzen", There
isn't any licensing information attached to those original bitmaps in
its official "README" document.

Assuming they are in the public domain, and with the original source
of the bitmaps (dzen website) now offline, they found their new home
on the "Awesome" window manager wiki.
